# Concisely

**Summarize long-form videos into structured insights in minutes.**  
Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **FastAPI**, and **PostgreSQL**.

---

## Overview

**Concisely** is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload long-form videos (e.g. lectures, podcasts, meetings) and receive:

- **Executive Summary**
- **Action Items**
- **Topic Highlights**

The system is designed to process videos up to from upload to final summary, using an optimized batch pipeline and multi-stage summarization.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **AI Pipeline**: whisper.cpp, FFmpeg, OpenAI GPT-4 API

---

## Features

- **Modular Upload & Viewer**  
  Built with reusable React components to support file uploads, summary display, and view toggling.

- **Multi-stage AI Summarization**  
  Transcripts are segmented and processed in stages for GPT-4 to generate summaries with higher coherence and structure.

- **Efficient Transcription Pipeline**  
  Utilizes `whisper.cpp` for fast CPU-based transcription and `FFmpeg` for audio preprocessing.

- **Batch Processing**  
  Large transcripts are split into chunks to avoid token overflow and are summarized in a distributed batch pipeline.

- **Persistent Storage**  
  Summaries and transcripts are stored and retrieved using a PostgreSQL database.

---

## Example Use Case
1. Upload a 90-minute lecture video via the UI.
2. Audio is extracted and transcribed locally using `whisper.cpp`.
3. Transcript is segmented and passed through GPT-4 in batches.
4. Final summaries are rendered on the frontend with view tabs for:
   - Executive Summary  
   - Action Items  
   - Topic Highlights

---

## Performance
- **2-hour lecture → Summary in under 5 minutes**
- Fast transcription enabled by `whisper.cpp` and optimized chunking
- Summaries generated via GPT-4 with structured outputs

---

## Future Improvements
- Docker-based deployment
- User authentication and summary history
- Replace local PostgreSQL with a managed cloud service like Supabase

---

## Installation
